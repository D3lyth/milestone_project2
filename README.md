# üçíEmoji Match

Emoji is a fun, logic game for everyone of all ages to use. It is based on a logic board game from the 1970s, called Mastermind. 

The Mastermind game involved two players, in which one of the players chose a sequence of coloured pegs, and the other player had to correctly deduce the sequence of coloured pegs in a certain number of guesses.

The player would be told if the pegs were in the right place, or told that the correct colour was present, but in the incorrect position.

Emoji Match is also based on another, more recent game - Wordle.

Emoji is an updated, digital version of the Mastermind game, where instead of a sequence of coloured pegs is used, a sequence of emojis are randomly chosen and can be played on a device rather than a board. 

Also, instead of coming up with a random word (like Wordle), it is a sequence of emojis that is needed, opening up the game to younger users.

The target audience could be anyone that can use a PC or a device such as a mobile phone or a tablet. Emoji Match offers a logic game that uses images rather than words, therfore the ability to spell is not a pre-requisite. But due to its puzzling nature, Emoji Match should also provide the challenge to those who like to keep the mind busy.

Here is a mockup image using the "Am I Responsive" website.

## UX

The design is based on a board game and the online game Wordle. It will contain the logo/title, buttons to check the instructions and to begin a new game. There will then be the 'gameboard' where emojis will appear. Below the gameboard a guess button will be placed and then an on-screen keyboard to be able to populate the gameboard tiles with emojis.

Below the gameboard are some credits and links to social media.

Users will also see the correct answer appear if they don't get the correct answer in 6 guesses or less, and the title will change to a 'GAME OVER' message. A 'well done' message will also appear if the user manages to guess the answer in 6 guesses or less.

### Colour Scheme

Due to the nature of the game and the colours of the emojis used, I have tried to keep the rest of the page quite neutral other than a pop of colour in the title/logo and the footer. I felt like too much colour on the background would make the page look too busy and effect accessibility.

- `#000000` has been used for primary text.
- `#fffff` has been used for button text.
- `#cd0ffc` has been used for instructional text, icons and other text.
- `#f3f3f3` has been used as a background colour as off-white is less harsh on the eyes and better for accessibility.

I used [We Love Colours](https://www.welovecolors.com/) as inspiration to research a colour pallete, which although (other than the emojis themselves) doesn't have a lot of colour, I wanted to incoroprate a neon theme.

### Typography

The fonts were chosen for the Emoji Match game due to their fun nature. The game is supposed to appeal to all ages, therefore the playfulness aspect of the fonts needed to be showcased. 

- [Bungee Shade](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee+Shade) was used for the primary headers and titles. This font was chosen as it is a reminder of 'old school' or 'vintage' video games from the 80s.

- Classic emojis were used throughout. Emojis can look slightly different dependent on browser/operating systems/devices, but they are included using Unicode to ensure that the correct emoji is being used.

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used GoodNotes, and iPad and an Apple Pencil to design my site wireframes.

## Features

### Existing Features

- **How to Play Button**

    - This button when clicked will bring up a modal clearly explaining how to play the game to all users - including diagrams to show the user what to anticipate whilst playing the game.

![screenshot](documentation/feature01.png)

- **New Game Button**

    - This button when clicked will start a new game for the user. This must be clicked at the start of every game.
![screenshot](documentation/feature02.png)

- **Game Board**

    - When emojis are selected, they will populate the game board. After a guess has been made, the tiles will change colour using the traffic light system (red for incorrect emoji, yellow for correct emoji, but wrong position and green for correct emoji in correct position).

![screenshot](documentation/feature03.png)

- **Emoji Keyboard**

    - The on-screen emoji keyboard will allow the user to be able to select the emojis to be able to play the game. If and emoji is clicked, it will fill the tile. If the 5th tile in a row is filled, no more emojis can be clicked unless the row is cleared, an emoji is deleted using the backspace button, or the guess button has been clicked.

![screenshot](documentation/feature04.png)

- **Clear Button**

    - This button, when clicked, will clear a whole row of emojis to allow the user to select their emojis correctly.

![screenshot](documentation/feature05.png)

- **Backspace Button**

    - This button, when clicked, will clear one emoji at a time, incase the user changes their mind regarding the placement of certain emojis.

![screenshot](documentation/feature06.png)

- **Guess Button**

    - This button, when clicked, will chekc the selected emojis against the answer to see if the user has been able to guess the sequence of emojis correctly.

![screenshot](documentation/feature07.png)

- **'Well Done' message**

    - The 'well done' message will appear if the user has been able to correctly guess the sequence of emojis in 6 guesses or less.

![screenshot](documentation/feature08.png)

- **'Correct Answer' message**

    - The 'Correct Answer' message will appear at the end of the game - either when the person correctly guesses the sequence as a confirmation message, or when the user doesn't manage to get the answer correct after 6 guesses so that they can see what the answer should be.

![screenshot](documentation/feature09.png)

- **'Game Over Banner' message**

    - The gamne over banner will appear in llace of the logo to show that the game has come to an end if the user has not been able to solve the correct emoji sequence.

![screenshot](documentation/feature10.png)

### Future Features

- Different Themes
    - Currently, Emoji Match has a food theme. In a future feature, various themes can be included and the user would be able to choose the theme - this may be animals, emoji faces, flags etc. 
- Difficulty Level
    - In future versions, the user could have an option to choose an easy, medium or hard game. This could mean that the user can have more than 6 guesses to try and get the answer correct. Another way of changing the challenge could be that more or less emojis need to be matched.
- Scoreboard
    - A scoreboard can also be added to keep a tally of how many games the user have managed to win or lose.
    - The scoreboard could also include information like the average guesses that the user has made to get to the answer.
- Once a day game
    - Currently, the user can click on the new game button and the user can play over and over again.
    - The game can be modified to only allow one game a day and a winning streak can be recorded.
- Celebration
    - A celebratory confetti animation could be added for style purposes (and similarly a commiseration message animation).

### Local VS Deployment

Comparing Local vs live deployment, there doesn't seem to be any differences in the websites.

## Credits

### Content

Below is a list of some of the websites that I used to help completing the website.

The colour-changing heading code used was code that I had used previously on another project (credited in table below):

```css
h1 {animation: color-change 2s infinite;
}

@keyframes color-change {
  0% { color: #64ff00; }
  25% { color: #FC49AB; }
  50% { color: #ffa500; }
  75% { color: #ffFF00; }
  100% { color: #64ff00; }
}
```

Some of the logic used for the JavaScript/HTML/css element of the code was inspired by Kenny Yip, and a tutorial by Kenny Yip Coding was followed. This tutorial was for a basic Wordle game. Credits and links are given in the table below.

### Media

No media has been used for the site, other than the emojis displayed. Unicode is used to show the emojis (in the title, the tiles, keyboard and 'well done' message). The images taken for the instructions modal are screen shots of the gameplay and compressed using TinyPNG.
