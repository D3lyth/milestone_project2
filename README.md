# 🍒Emoji Match

Emoji is a fun, logic game for everyone of all ages to use. It is based on a logic board game from the 1970s, called Mastermind. 

The Mastermind game involved two players, in which one of the players chose a sequence of coloured pegs, and the other player had to correctly deduce the sequence of coloured pegs in a certain number of guesses.

The player would be told if the pegs were in the right place, or told that the correct colour was present, but in the incorrect position.

Emoji Match is also based on another, more recent game - Wordle.

Emoji is an updated, digital version of the Mastermind game, where instead of a sequence of coloured pegs is used, a sequence of emojis are randomly chosen and can be played on a device rather than a board. 

Also, instead of coming up with a random word (like Wordle), it is a sequence of emojis that is needed, opening up the game to younger users.

The target audience could be anyone that can use a PC or a device such as a mobile phone or a tablet. Emoji Match offers a logic game that uses images rather than words, therfore the ability to spell is not a pre-requisite. But due to its puzzling nature, Emoji Match should also provide the challenge to those who like to keep the mind busy.

Here is a mockup image using the "Am I Responsive" website.

## UX

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

In this section, you will briefly explain your design processes.

### Colour Scheme

Due to the nature of the game and the colours of the emojis used, I have tried to keep the rest of the page quite neutral other than a pop of colour in the title/logo and the footer. I felt like too much colour on the background would make the page look too busy and effect accessibility.

- `#000000` has been used for primary text.
- `#fffff` has been used for button text.
- `#cd0ffc` has been used for icon and footer text.

I used [We Love Colours](https://www.welovecolors.com/) as inspiration to research a colour pallete, which although (other than the emojis themselves) doesn't have a lot of colour, I wanted to incoroprate a neon theme.

### Typography

The fonts were chosen for the Emoji Match game due to their fun nature. The game is supposed to appeal to all ages, therefore the playfulness aspect of the fonts needed to be showcased. 

- [Bungee Shade](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee+Shade) was used for the primary headers and titles. This font was chosen as it is a reminder of 'old school' or 'vintage' video games from the 80s.

- Classic emojis were used throughout. Emojis can look slightly different dependents on browser/operating systems/devices, but they are included using Unicode to ensure that the correct emoji is being used.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Features

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project,
and describe each in a sentence or so.

You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user,
focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve,
and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

IMPORTANT: Remember to always include a screenshot of each individual feature!

### Future Features

- Different Themes
    - Currently, Emoji Match has a food theme. In a future feature, various themes can be included and the user would be able to choose the theme - this may be animals, emoji faces, flags etc. 
- Difficulty Level
    - In future versions, the user could have an option to choose an easy, medium or hard game. This could mean that the user can have more than 6 guesses to try and get the answer correct. Another way of changing the challenge could be that more or less emojis need to be matched.
- Scoreboard
    - A scoreboard can also be added to keep a tally of how many games the user have managed to win or lose.
    - The scoreboard could also include information like the average guesses that the user has made to get to the answer.
- Once a day game
    - Currently, the user can click on the new game button and the user can play over and over again.
    - The game can be modified to only allow one game a day and a winning streak can be recorded.
- Celebration
    - A celebratory confetti animation could be added for style purposes (and similarly a commiseration message animation).
